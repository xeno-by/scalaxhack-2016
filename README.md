We'll arrange a schedule on the day based on what peoples' interests.
We'll aim to have a mix of hacking and short talks/workshops.
This is a collection of ideas and proposals.

## Projects to hack on

  Include a quick description of the library 
  and what you'd like to work on at the hack day.
  Please keep descriptions short.
  Feel free to link to extra information.
  We suggest including a link to your issue tracker
  and highlighting simple issues for newcomers.

- **Miles Sabin, Typelevel Scala Compiler**

  http://github.com/typelevel/scala

  Compiler hacking is fun and not as scary as you might think.
  In this session we'll fork, clone, build, tweak, 
  and use the Typelevel Scala compiler 
  as an introduction to compiler hacking.

- **Eugene Burmako, Scala.Meta and Macro Paradise**

  Hackathon on scala.meta and new-style macros.
  We'll have a bunch of approachable issues for newcomers.

  (talk, hands-on workshop, round-table, etc)

  An easy introduction to shapeless, 
  working on a few of the examples from the
  [Shapelss Guide](http://github.com/underscoreio/shapeless-guide).
